The filesystems program involves creating a valid Ext2 filesystem image with specific structures, including directories, a regular file, and a symbolic link. The filesystem is designed to be 1 MiB in size, with 1 KiB-sized blocks and space for 128 inodes. The goal is to understand and implement the internal structures of an Ext2 filesystem, including the superblock, block group descriptor table, block and inode bitmaps, inode table, root directory, and specific file types with proper ownership and permissions. The provided skeleton code includes functions for writing these structures and associated macros, and the created filesystem is validated through mounting, filesystem checks, and examining its contents. The lab emphasizes understanding filesystem internals and utilizing system calls for filesystem creation.
